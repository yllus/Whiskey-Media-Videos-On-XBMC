Whiskey Media Videos on XBMC
----------------------------

INTRODUCTION

This add-on allows paid subscribers to the Whiskey Media content network (GiantBomb.com, Tested.com, Screened.com, 
ComicVine.com and AnimeVice.com) to stream recent videos from any of the sites directly to their XBMC device. 

This add-on features:
   - Loads content from all 5 Whiskey Media websites
   - Contains subcategories within each website for easy navigation
   - Selectable video quality level: HD (High Definition), High, Low and Mobile
   - The fastest menu load speed money can buy


INSTALLATION

Install the add-on via the official add-on repository. To install this add-on manually, click the Downloads link 
on https://github.com/yllus/Whiskey-Media-Videos-On-XBMC/tree/release and extract the files to your XBMC device 
within the folder /addons/plugin.video.whiskeymedia/ . Now browse to the add-on within XBMC under the Videos menu, 
where it will now appear.

On your initial load of the add-on, the settings window will automatically pop up. You must fill in your (valid) 
Whiskey Media multi-pass username and password before using the add-on. Without that, you'll be unable to load 
a list of videos under each website's categories, much less view the videos themselves. Hopefully one day in the 
near future this will cease to be a requirement.

Also configurable in the settings window is the video quality level. "High" is selected by default - "HD" is 
available as an option, as are two lower levels of video quality.

Lastly, the add-on settings window can be viewed by choosing the Change Settings option in the top-level menu list 
(that is, the one that lists the various Whiskey Media websites).
