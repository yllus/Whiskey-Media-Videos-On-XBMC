This add-on allows paid subscribers to the Whiskey Media content network (GiantBomb.com, Tested.com, Screened.com, 
ComicVine.com and AnimeVice.com) to stream recent videos from any of the sites directly to their XBMC device. 

This add-on features:

* Contains subcategories within each website for easy navigation.

* Selectable video quality level: HD (High Definition), High, Low and Mobile.
 
* Audio streaming of the Giant Bombcast, Comic Vine Podcast, This is Only a Test and Behind the Screened 
  Door podcasts.

quite right):

Installation
------------

Install the add-on via the official add-on repository. To install this add-on manually, click the Downloads link 
on https://github.com/yllus/Whiskey-Media-Videos-On-XBMC/tree/release and extract the files to your XBMC device 
within the folder /addons/plugin.video.whiskeymedia/ . Now browse to the add-on within XBMC under the Videos menu, 
where it will now appear.

On your initial load of the add-on, the settings window will automatically pop up. You must fill in your (valid) 
Whiskey Media multi-pass username and password before using the add-on. Without that, you'll be unable to load 
a list of videos under each website's categories, much less view the videos themselves. Hopefully one day in the 
near future this will cease to be a requirement.

Also configurable in the settings window is the video quality level. "High" is selected by default - "HD" is 
available as an option, as are two lower levels of video quality.

Lastly, the add-on settings window can be viewed by choosing the Change Settings option in the top-level menu list 
(that is, the one that lists the various Whiskey Media websites).


Known Issues
------------

* Once a video has been streamed in its entirety, it is removed from the RSS feed your user account sees. This has the effect of making the video 
  you've just watched disappear from the video list. This appears to be intentional behaviour designed to lower bandwidth usage. For this reason, 
  I don't recommend use of the HD quality mode.

* Retrieval of the video feeds appears to require your Giant Bomb / Tested / Screened / etc website password, as opposd to your overall Whiskey 
  Media Multi-Pass username. For this reason, if you do not have the same username across each website you will encounter an error when trying 
  to retrieve a list of videos from a website where your username is not what you specified in the add-on settings page.
